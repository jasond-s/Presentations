# Scaling

***

# JFDI

( just do it )

---

I cannot stress this enough.

---

With the numbers going up, a lot can change while you are inactive.

***

# Culture and Process

---

## There isn't one

If you double every year.

---

### It's you.

This is set by the people and what they do.

# You have all the agency 

---

### At least not in the way you think there is.

Diverse teams are higher performing. 

Cross functional, cross cultural.

That's part of the fun IMHO.

***

# Velocity

---

## Small and often

Prove you can when it matters by doing every day when it doesn't.

---

### Think, but don't think too much.

Make a hypothesis and try it. 

Try and measure objectively.



---

### Libraries > Frameworks

- A basket of tools to solve a wide variety of problems as close to the raw features of the underlying technology.
- Don't build solving machines they will need to be broken and rebuilt. all. the. time.

***

# Operations is going to be a big deal

### All engineers are SREs and devops engineers now

***

# Hire Fast
# Fire Fast

---

This is trash. 

Hiring is expensive and firing is depressing.

Unless you are a psychopath.

---

# Hire With Purpose
# Fire With Conviction

---

Always have a well defined job for who you are hiring.

If you have to fire, build a case.

Rewrite the hiring process and review the performance monitoring.

Don't hire bad people.

Don't allow toxicity.
