# Defending the indefensible

### Clean Code

1. Code is read more than it is written.
2. Tests do more for your design than verifying a spec you already know.
3. The smaller the context for the unit of code, the better.
4. Encapsulate business rules only once and reuse them.
5. Be consistent.
6. Review code all the time with your peers.

> Programming is the art of telling another human what one wants the computer to do. — Donald Knuth, 1968

## This wasn't necessarily ground breaking.
### The only reason we are talking about still is because it helped a lot of people in a lot of ways.

---

## There are no books you should read and no body of knowledge that is complete

---

There are now a bunch of works by other authors that have refined these ideas, taken them deeper and built on top to create a rich canon. 

This book is old and it's examples are all old, and they aren't good anymore there are much better ways to do those things. 

---

## So why might we still care?

---

### Old Books

You might choose to read a book because it's place in the canon still represents the pinnacle of *current* understanding.

You might also read a book because it represents a portion of a narrative arch, it's leads you to other works.

Some points along that narrative might be naïve but offer a perspective for a number of richer topics. 

--- 

### Instructional Books

Because knowing the journey to getting here allows you understand the changes in context that lead to the current outcome. 

Without understanding the journey you might fail to understand the reasons and repeat aspects of the past that we tried to correct.

### Not this over that, but this instead of that.

What was clean code instead of?

---

# I don't think you should read 
# Clean Code.

---

# I think you should read, a lot, and build a sense of the narrative of software engineering.
