# Attack Surface

#### How large is your system

#### How complex is your system

# Attack Vectors

#### Routes for attack:

#### APIs

#### Infrastructure

---

# Blast Area

#### At the end of any vector 

#### what can be damaged, lost, or stolen

# Aggro

#### Posture in the world:

#### Positive PR

#### Negative PR

# Least Privilege 
# &
# Least Power

#### These are general rules to limit risks.

---

# Circles of Trust

#### In any group there is an understanding of the balance between being open or closed. There is a connection to the systems and people that own those systems. 

#### Trust is built on mutual understanding of risk and reward. The subtleties of each system demand understanding the subtleties of each persons ability to be trusted with an open door. 

### Everyone can't know and control everything. In fact, nobody can.

---

# Separation of Powers

#### Nobody should have the power to act and the ability to grant that power to others.

### Elevating your own permissions is very naughty indeed.

# Least Privilege

### Reducing network access

1. Limiting service to service access.
2. Single point of entry, WAF
3. Caller identity based authorization
4. VPN access only to the running system.

</br>
</br>

#### Virtual Private Network - put your machine 'inside' the cloud.

### What does it look like?

#### not this, but also, a bit this?

# Least Power

### Segregating monoliths of power

#### If everyone has access to everything the blast radius can be large

1. Storage - all the data corrupted at once
2. Messaging - false information propagated quickly
3. Secret management - skeleton keys

#### [The better we are has obvious downside protection.](https://www.oneadvanced.com/cyber-incident/#block454814)

#### The better we are allows us to sail through legals and technical pre-sales. 

#### Security is a feature we can sell.
