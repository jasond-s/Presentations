About Me:

I have worked for Codat since the early days, I was the first employee and knew the founders at our previous company, which is where the idea for Codat was born. 
I've worked in all sorts of other industries and started my life as an electronics engineer, moving up the stack through firmware, embedded devices, desktops apps, all the way to the web.
I have also worked in all sorts of roles, obviously as an engineer, but also a scrum master, a manager, consultant, technical sales, and as a business analyst.
Hopefully all of this experience has made me better at doing the job I have now. This usually means trying to help guide policy and coordinate people around problems that need focus. 
My job is generally about listening to things that are hard, or finding things that are hard, and then organising engineers around making it better. 
I am also a sucker for an opportunity to write code and like to get involved when asked to, I built a lot of the shared code at Codat originally and while I don't directly own anything anymore, I help out when I can.
If you want to know what it's like to work with me please have a look at my readme (https://managerreadme.com/readme/jasond_s).


Add some nice humanising words, you sounds like a coding robot.

About Engineering:

The Prime Directives

Codat is an API first company. We should be aiming at all times to ensure that all useful solutions to problems that Codat solves are available via an API authorisation and our api.codat.io domain. These should have clear, simple, and well documented modes of operation and there should be only one way to do something. Explicit over implicit. 

Expect change, take ownership, and have a flawless professional practice. We build systems within engineering that are built to last, and ready to change. Quality is never flexible, but scope usually is. Any product we release will have been thoroughly analysed and thoughtfully designed, agile is not an excuse to shoot from the hip or cut corners.

Systems must support flexibility. When building products we should not just be thinking about the technical flexibility, but also the flexibility of the use case. The power of Codat’s system in in the ability to create products on top of our own system, think about how you would expose functionality to a client, even if you don’t have to today.

Systems must be resilient. Security, Observability, and monitoring are as optional as testing, we must ensure that we react swiftly to operational issues and use the data proactively to look for improvements to the client experience. 


Reverse the point of view so it's not an expectation but a description. Organisation and structure. Sexy scale numbers.
