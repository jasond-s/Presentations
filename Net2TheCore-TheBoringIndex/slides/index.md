# The Boring Index

## Who am I

</br>

Engineer for ages,</br>
manager for not quite so long,</br>
but I've done some time.

</br>

I have always written enterprise code in the .NET space, apart from a brief stint writing network protcols in C for embedded devices.

This has given me a bunch of biases around things in that space. 

Not the cleverest person in the room, just the one talking.

#### Boring Technology Synopsis

</br>

## Question

1. What technology should you choose?
2. How do you keep developers happy?

---

</br>

## Answer

- Shiny new cool fun things.

> I know enough about quantum physics to know I literally know nothing about it. But I will try to do the plumbing in my apartment because I didn't know I knew nothing about plumbing.

#### Boring Technology Synopsis

The true cost of any technology is a factor of 2 things:

### 1. The velocity value. 

You are probably hoping this is short term negative, long term positive or else why are you even looking at it!

### 2. The maintenance value. 

This is probably short term negative and very long term, maybe less negative, it's never free.

---

#### Boring Technology Synopsis

The reality is that the term that dominates this equation is pretty much always going to be the second one.

## Innovation Tokens

Just a thought experiment **no ICO required**. These grant the bearer the time to spend exploring the unknown unknowns.

Each time you want to tread unchartered waters you will probably have to spend one of these on:

</br>

### 1. The business case.

</br>

### 2. The technology.

#### Boring Technology Synopsis

The thing that pays your salary is, sadly, and obviously,</br>
the ability for the software you write to make money, </br>
not for the software you write to be built using </br>
**the right tool for the job** (sic).

## My sad story

---

### Polyglots

</br>

Databases are a good example for this.</br> 
In Codat's case this was Cosmos DB on Azure.

We have all worked in a team that operates a SQL database probably very effectively, that has, at sometime, had someone in it that said 'we should be using kafka for persistence' or whatever flavour you prefer.

# OPERATING SYSTEMS AT SCALE IS HARD

#### My sad story

We are all easily swayed by the promise of a brighter tomorrow.

## The Index Factors

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

### Stay Humble

Is is easy to find articles online that talk, at detail about how awful the technology is?

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

### Maturity

Is the technology younger than your company?

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

### Mentors

Has anyone currently working at your company used this technology in production?

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

### AoE

What is the blast radius <span style="text-decoration: line-through">if</span> when the thing explodes <span style="text-decoration: line-through">during testing</span> in production.

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

### Cost

If your load increases linearly, does the operating cost? 

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

## Innovation Tokens

You can spend these to mitigate a few of these factors of course:

Can you stand to be an early adopter, do you have a good relationship with core contributors? Can you find a centre of excellence and afford good training? Can you run the new system in parallel with an old one and build a kill switch? Do you have a war chest or margin enough to swallow rising costs?

Some of these are pure technology 'spend', some are indirectly business case innovation.

---

#### The Boring Index

</br>

### When to spend?

You can only spend innovation tokens **before** a release date, you can't spend an innovation token after it gets to production. Firefighting is a constant, that's why we have SRE, but they can't be working out how to debug something when the world is on fire, or, they won't stay long if you ask them to.

> You **must** roleplay incidents before adoption. Think of it like 3 amigos for architecture and technology selection.

## Weights

Many of these factors (and you might have your own) will be weighted differently for any given team:

e.g. Does everyone know 3 language including an FP one? Maybe a new language isn't innovation.
