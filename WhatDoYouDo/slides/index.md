### Some things I am accountable for the process.
### In some areas I am accountable for the outcome.

---

#### Activity
It's basically loads of talking to people and then loads of writing and calendar booking.
This is building the process/framework or whatever.
Some hypothesis based on assumptions that we have to then measure.

---

#### Accountable
Are people following the process?
Are the hypotheses we made correct and should we continue?

---

#### Technical Stakeholder
Are we making good decisions as an organisation.
Are we applying tech everywhere we should and could be?
